My personal goal for this program is to be able to have a decent understanding of python principles and an all rounded basic understanding of programming fundamentals. My end goal is to grow from being a QA engineer currently to an SDET, where I can master in technical skills like writing robust tests using python, testing APIs on a service level, learning CI/DCD set ups and processes as well.
Should be a fun journey. Looking forward to the outcome.
